        <h2>Fire Safety for Everyone</h2>

        <p>
            Fire safety isn't just something adults talk about—it's something everyone can learn,
            including kids! Fires can happen at home, at school, or anywhere, but many can be stopped
            before they start.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Ember Shield helps children and teachers learn how to stay safe with easy steps like:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Spotting fire dangers (like hot stoves or frayed wires)</li>
            <li>Making a classroom or home escape plan</li>
            <li>Learning how smoke alarms and fire extinguishers work</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Whether you're a student learning for the first time or a teacher helping your class
            prepare, this site gives you tools to protect what matters most. Because when it comes to
            fire, every second counts—and being ready makes all the difference.
